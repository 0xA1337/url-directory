# url-directory

This repository contains one of the domain/url sources we use for anti-phishing purposes in the [DefiLlama browser extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/defillama/phgiabfbjodhgckcffppiboooeiecgeg).

To propose an addition, please fork and open a PR.

**NOTE:** This list is only one of the url sources we use in the DefiLlama extension, and is mainly for websites which are not DeFi protocols that have a TVL (eg. CEXs, wallet apps, blockchain projects).

If you represent a DeFi protocol, please refrain from opening a PR to this repo. Your protocol's website will be dynamically whitelisted in the extension as long as it has significant amount of TVL.
